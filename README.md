# WhoCalls
WhoCalls can query a directory of files, find the binaries, and search for a user specified Win API import. It works with both 32-bit (PE) and 64-bit (PE32+) file formats (.exe, .dll, .sys)
This is an improved version of my old C WhoCalls program. The old C version can be found [here](https://github.com/DownWithUp/WhoCalls_C).

## Example Use
WhoCalls.exe [Path To Query] [API Name]
API Name: A valid Windows API function. eg: ExitProcess<br/>
Path To Query: A valid path without the ending backslash. eg: C:\Users\Admin\Desktop
